# LocalFileDb

This is an update/replacement of my short-lived [FileDb](https://github.com/adamosoftware/FileDb) project. I wanted to remove the ORM dependency. I got the MP3 player app bug again, and I think it depends on having a good way to sync file metadata with a database. I can see other document management applications also.
